# Jetbrains Academy - Tasklist

My solutions for the Jetbrains Academy Problem 'Tasklist'

https://hyperskill.org/projects/237

The solution is build up step by step over several stages. 
Stage 1 is the first and simple one. The following stages 
build up on the previous stages and get more and more advanced.
There are six stages in total.

Because each stage is completely independent of the previous one,
IntelliJ might show some warnings about duplicated code between 
the stages.

## Stage 1

[click here to see description @ JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/projects/237/stages/1188/implement)

Read some simple tasks and list them

just execute this:

    gradle -PmainClass=stage1.MainKt run --console=plain

## Stage 2

[click here to see description @ JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/projects/237/stages/1189/implement)

Add a menu to add and print tasks and end app.

just execute this:

    gradle -PmainClass=stage2.MainKt run --console=plain

## Stage 3

Add date and time to each task.

just execute this:

    gradle -PmainClass=stage3.MainKt run --console=plain

## Stage 4

[click here to see description @ JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/projects/237/stages/1191/implement)

Edit single task and add tag to check if task is due or not.

just execute this:

    gradle -PmainClass=stage4.MainKt run --console=plain

## Stage 5

[click here to see description @ JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/projects/237/stages/1192/implement)

Make the print out of task list look nice, with ANSI colors for priority and due tag.

just execute this:

    gradle -PmainClass=stage5.MainKt run --console=plain

## Stage 6

[click here to see description @ JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/projects/237/stages/1193/implement)

Load and save task list to JSON file.

just execute this:

    gradle -PmainClass=stage6.MainKt run --console=plain
